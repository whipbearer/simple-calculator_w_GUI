You could download the executable to have the full experience or the python file that I used to make this.

I was able to convert the python to an executable through pyinstaller.
Follow these steps:

Open cmd and run the following command:
'pip install pyinstaller'

Next, navigate to the path where you python file is saved (replace path with the actuall directory):
'cd *path*/'

Run the following command:
'pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole *file name*.py'

It will create 2 new folders and 1 file.
Your executable will be located in the **dist** folder.

This is purely out of practice and have no intent to make profit or fame from this.
